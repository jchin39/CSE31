breakpoints are places where the debugger will stop running the program.
You can set it up with break (line) ex. break 10.
use n to go line by line
to see values of variables, use command p (variable name)
to finish the program you can use command c
to quit, you can press q.

TPS 3
there are 4 variables declared, 2 of them are pointers.
x= 0, y is 16 and arr[0] is 8.
to fix this, you can initialize them all as 0, or something else.
Yes, the results are the same. It makes sense since arr is a pointer, and pointers point to addresses. so the address of arr should be the same as printing the pointer.
