Tps 1
Static storage: Global variable storage
The Stack: Local variable storage
The Heap: dynamic malloc storage

3 variables are declared
2 are pointers, they point to integers.
These are stored on the Stack
ptr goes to the heap.

TPS 2
NodeStruct creates a dynamically allocated structure in memory which is constructed of two values.
Structures are stored on the heap, as the space allocated for them is done so by malloc.
