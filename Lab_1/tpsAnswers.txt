Printf("insert value")
scanf(value) do this until value is 0
add values to array.
count++ for amount of non zero values.
for (int i = 0; i < count; i ++) {
    split up each value at index i into digits
    Modulo by 10 to get digit, then divide number by 10 to get next digit. 
    each digit will be added to a sum until value is zero.

    check if sum of digits is even or odd then put value in appropriate array.
}
for each array of odd or even numbers,
int sum = sum + indexed value of array.
then print.
